          As a music consumer in 2015, access and availability to content has never been more convenient or quantiful. Since the onset of the digital era we have seen a enormous change in the way music is discovered, listened to, distributed and monetised. It has changed the industry immensely with multiple different models of monetisation being experimented with, and the industry desperately trying to catch up to a constantly moving consumer base. It has also had a great affect on the definition of musician. Recently Robert Forster, of 80s Australian band The Go-Betweens, in speech discussing his career, commented on his shock at the change of attitude with young musicians, who no longer have any expectations of monetary gain from their art, as well as his own shock at the loss of his "superannuation" of songwriting royalties being pulled out from under him.

          What ever you opinion on the relationship between money and music, it is clear that the changes taking place will and are affecting the way we not only access music, but the way it is created. Like in any revolution, there is never a simple fix to the issues that new liberation creates. It is however possible to contribute to the path the future takes. The regular music consumer has many different options, and has the power to influence the future through their own choices. Whether considering industry ethics, personal satisfaction, or simply wanted to help the artists they enjoy, the choices music consumers make can have an impact on the overall industry.

        It is however an area of certain confusion. Lengthy user agreements, pop star outcries, media manipulation and just a simple misunderstanding of the issue all contribute to hazy playing field that is difficult to navigate. In exploring the changes and new dominant platforms of the industry, as well as their alternatives (some more realistic than others), we can attempt to clear the fog, and give a straightforward map for music consumers to make their own ethical decisions.

        <h2 id="the-traditional-model">The Traditional Model</h2>
        <p>The traditional music industry model was the dominant form for decades, but has slowly fallen away since the late 90s with advent of file sharing, and illegal downloading. The slow pace it which the industry moved online certainly contributed to its demise, and although profits from digital sales have steadily over the ensuing years, they are taking a share of an ever decreasing profit.</p>


        <img src="images/stereo.png" alt="" />

        <p>Itunes has long been the leader of this sales model, but has long been know for its poor treatment of the artists who&#39;s music they are selling(link). Of the 99c paid for downloading a song on itunes, the artist can expect between 20-70, depending on the generosity of their label. Although certainly not the worst of the big industry, itunes do have the monopoly over music downloads, and thus most artists must go with them in order to make their music available. They are however being quickly caught up on by the next category.</p>

            <p>
              Streaming services have becoming increasingly popular in the last 3-5 years, and a wider variety of platforms are becoming available. Spotify, being launched back on 2012, is certainly the most popular of these, though quickly being chased by Apples new Beats, and is approaching taking over as the new leader in music sales. This can be seen as industry finally catching up to consumer digital needs, and in the age of smartphones and portable music, seem like the perfect solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is interesting however, that these are mostly not an industry lead format, rather the product of entrepreneurs. Their business model of a company such as Spotify is also interesting, and displays their entrepreneurial nature. Although ever growing, the company is less concerned with profit and more with maintaining this growth. (link) Thus the company has actually turned losses in previous years and quotes&quot;&quot;.
            </p>

            <p>
              This needless to say does not bode well for their likelihood of supporting artists. Much has been written in criticism the nature of Spotifys payment practice, and we have even seen big name artists like Taylor Swift and Neil Young pull their catalogues in protest over poor deals. An fun piece to check compares the earnings of NYC subway buskers to revenue from streaming. But yes, the return on a stream on Spotify to an artist is tiny, equating to about $0.0011 per play, potentially less once a label gets involved, and less again if the user streaming does not have a paid subscription. This equates up to approximately 9,000 plays to earn enough to pay the $9.99 monthly subscription.

        <p>
          There is another point of view on the matter however. Spotify claims that it is actually saving the music industry, and reports of decreased music piracy with increased streaming memberships countries like Sweden seem to support this claim (link). The company also makes the argument that this is a new way of looking at music revenue, and that previous models of assessment are not valid. The suggestion is that the $0.70 an artist makes from their sale of a song on i tunes is a one off transaction, while earnings from Spotify have the potential to continue providing an artist with revenue for years to come. This is a proposition supported by some artists, who report that revenue from Spotify makes sense and is the logical direction for the future of music sales. Along with this argument however , is the increasing feeling among artists that album sales are no longer the be all and end all in making a successful living.</p>
        <h2 id="artist-driven-models">Artist Driven Models</h2>
        <p>
          While the previous models are the major revenue pullers in the current music industry landscape, they are industry focused and really are for the benefit of bigger artists, with greater pull and promotion budgets, or even as in the interest of keeping the industry itself alive. Since the late 90s there have been platforms for artist to share there music online, such as the long gone myspace, and there plenty that currently allow artists to make an income online, away from the industry mans pockets. Bandcamp, etc, etc, have all exist as hosting sites where music fans can come and buy digital and physical material, knowing that profits will mostly go directly to the artists. ???Bandcamp has been lauded for its artist-friendly business and design, making it a good choice for indie musicians. The only downside is that no revenue is generated from album streams, so if you like an artist and want them to make some money from Bandcamp, make sure to buy an album once in a while.????
        </p>
        <p>
          A step beyond is the proposition that the current system of monetising music is broken and needs to be overhauled for the 20th century. One proposed way of doing this is by looking way back to before the popularity of recorded music. //The patronage model looks at the old system of supporting musicians ala the 1800??? when wealthy benefactors would support musicians to produce and preform their art//. This concept has been re-envisioned as a contemporary solution to these issues. In this scenario recorded music would become free and accessible to anyone. Revenue for artist would then be provided to artist by contributions from fans, ideally on a regular basis in exchange for extra content, and through performance and sales of merchandise. This model is very much artist driven, which is a positive thing, and allows fans to directly contribute to music they care about. It has gain a good amount of positive attention support recently (link) given its interesting new approach and restoration of music away from corporations. The major issue many miss on this though, is that that these are essentially the circumstances under which things currently work. Music <em>is</em> free to anyone who wants it, albeit illegally, and if this were to be an effective solution, it would probably occur on its own. Clearly reliance on industry is still necessary to some extent in order for artists to make a living out of music.

        <h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>
          In a sense the game is hard its difficult to find a win. Artist driven models are not as effective as industry driven, and industry cant be expected to play fair. Still in navigating the minefield it does appear that the better of the evils would be the streaming option, though they could certainly improve practices. Beyond that some interesting, if impractical, have been suggested which raise interesting questions.
